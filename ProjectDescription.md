# Project Description

## Summary

This project is a technical demonstration of Contentstack's capabilities for dynamic content delivery. The objective is to build a standalone macOS application that dynamically fetches and displays content from a Contentstack API, serving as a showcase for how a client application can be powered by a headless CMS.

The system will consist of two main components:
1.  **The Client:** A standalone application built with a game engine, responsible for all rendering, application logic, and user interaction.
2.  **Contentstack Backend:** The cloud-hosted Contentstack environment where all dynamic content is managed.

The Client will communicate with the Contentstack backend via HTTPS, using Contentstack's Delivery API to fetch content. This communication is one-way; the client reads data but does not write back to Contentstack.

## High-level Features

- Fetch and display global configuration data (e.g., a welcome message, feature flags) from the CMS upon application startup.
- Dynamically load and display lists of structured, queryable assets (e.g., item details, thumbnails, categories) managed in Contentstack.
- Dynamically load and display formatted informational content (e.g., articles, announcements, updates) from the CMS.
- Support on-demand content refreshing when a user navigates to a specific content screen, ensuring the data is always current.
- Parse JSON responses from the API into native application objects and data structures.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- The final product must be a self-contained, standalone `.app` bundle for macOS.
- The application must not require an installer and should be able to run directly after unzipping.
- The client application must be built using a mainstream, professional engine (e.g., Godot, Unity) capable of producing a polished product.
- The application must handle API errors gracefully (e.g., no network connection, failed request) without crashing.
- API keys, environment tokens, and other sensitive credentials must be stored securely in a configuration file and excluded from source control (e.g., via `.gitignore`).

## Constraints

- The application target platform is **macOS only** for the scope of this demonstration.
- The content flow is **one-way only** (read-only). The client will only consume content from the Delivery API and will not write data back.
- The recommended engine for development is the **Godot Engine**, as it strikes the best balance of being lightweight, free, and capable for this project's needs.
