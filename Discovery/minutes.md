# Capstone Meeting Discovery

**Minute Taker**: Brandon Dean <br/>
**Date:** Thursday, September 18, 2025 <br/>
**Topic:** Contentstack discovery meeting

## Why

- Building solutions for clients.
- What if you have a channel outside of web-dev?
- What if a game developer has non-browser-based APIs?

## Vision

- "Polished" is subjective.
- The menu is readable.
- A clean experience doesn't need to be complicated.
- The game is short; not looking for major changes to it.

## Game Interface

- Go into building setters.
- Dialogue can be in the CMS and instantly searchable.
- Different content for different people.
- Environmental aspects can be managed through the CMS.
- Walk into a store and see changes.

## Hosting/How it Works

- GUI-Based
- The "Stack" is the content for the project.
- The Stack has entries.
- Entries have content.
- Content can be updated in real-time.
- "Publish" button.
- GUI-based, so no coding language on the content-management side.
- Shut down/restart the game to pull new content.
- The game does not need to be fullscreen.
- The same interface for web and games.

## Stretch Goals

- Not a core feature.
- Content types for the store, dialogue, and so on.
- Manage the store and whatever is playable.
- Basic stuff like "Buy for 100 gold."

## Constraints

- Runs on Mac.
- Do research, can be for both Windows/Mac.
- It just cannot be web-based.
- All sales engineers have Macs.
- We will be showcasing changes in the CMS.

## Game Engine

- No huge, obscure engine.
- Godot, Unity, Unreal.
- Maintainable and easy to use.
- Is there an issue with complexity with this?
- Timeline added to scope document.
- Contentstack for everything.

## Progress

- Second meeting.
- "Hello World" for Contentstack.
- Each sprint.
- Milestones.
- Gain a list of requirements first.
- Then divide into sprints.

## Final Delivery

- Show stakeholders what's been done.
- Get it in front of real people.

## Game Design

- Need a document with a full description.
- Part of the CI/CD process would pull assets.
- The game downloads content on startup.
- The game downloads files locally on startup.
- Doesn't matter if it's 2D or 3D, but 2D is easier.
- Any way for the client to detect that content has changed?
- Yes, dynamically.
- Package lots of things and then do a full release.
- Things are updated at once.

## Next Meeting

- Thursday at 5pm.
- Research game engines that work well with dynamic content.
- Research platforms.
- Look over documentation.
- Research Contentstack API.
