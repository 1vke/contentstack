# Business Requirement

- **BR1: The primary goal is to create a sales demonstration tool for Sales Engineers to attract new customers from the gaming industry**
  - Contentstack already has a presence in the gaming industry and explicitly states the business objective is to "extend this customer base" by creating a way to "attract those customers". The proposed method for achieving this is a video game demonstration designed to prove that "web isnâ€™t the only option" for their content delivery services. The proposal identifies the primary users of this tool as the company's Sales Engineers, describing them as the "primary source for demos" and the "technical conduit to the outside world for pre-sales". This indicates the project is not a consumer product, but a strategic internal tool whose function is to empower the sales team to achieve the core business objective of customer acquisition. It will do this by providing them with a polished, concrete example of Contentstack's value to the gaming vertical.
