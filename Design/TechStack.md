# Project Tech Stack

The tech stack for the Content Stack Project

## Constraints

Our tech stack is roughly constrained due to the use of the Content Stack API and our Game Engine

1. The project will be a Game that can be played on most platforms, but most especially MacOS

2. The project will pull it's assets directly from Content Stack

3. The project's assets must be 'hot-swappable' with the Content Stack API and entries in the Web-GUI

## Game Engine: [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

Godot has a node tree structure and a fairly solid and standard directory and file system that can be added to easily. It also has useful tools to pull game assets from external sources and they integrate easily. 

## Asset Pulls: [Content Stack](contentstack.com)

Content stack has a readable and easy to use web GUI that can be used by non-developers. It also has easy terminology and categorical devices to help people add content easily and quickly

## Manual Features / Advanced Features Within the Game: [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

[Godot's](https://godotengine.org/) GDScript works seamlessly with the C# language and allows for more advanced and manual tools and control over the game engines' aspects and assets.
